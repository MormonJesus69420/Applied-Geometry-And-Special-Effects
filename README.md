# Documentation
Documentation and general usage guide for project in STE6247 Applied Geometry and Special Effects.

## Getting Started
In order to run this project read following subheadings.

### Prerequisites
#### Libraries
 * GLEW can be found here: [GLEW Mainpage](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

### Running this code
Follow the [setup guide](GMlibSetupGuide2018.pdf) to set up your project and get it running on your PC. After that, you can run the project in QtCreator.

#### Running the application
If you have followed the instructions from setup guide you should have both projects open and ready to go. To run the application simply run the SpecialEffects project. You should be able to switch between what's shown on the screen by pressing `t` on your keyboard. 

Order of simulations are as follows:
 1. Simple B-Spline made from knot vector.
 2. Simple B-Spline made from sampling a circle.
 3. Blended curves using 20%, 50%, and 80% of original curves.
 4. Animated GERBS curve based off of a heart curve, animated to look like it's beating.
 5. GERBS surfaces based off of a plane, cylinder and torus with one of the sub-planes translated out as to show that it truly works. 

If you cannot run the application you can see the video of my project in action here: [https://youtu.be/6ehhbwDZfwg](Applied Geometry And Special Effects on YouTube)
